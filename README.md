This is a C++ program that takes a text file as an input and creates data structures that store consecutive word pairs. It calculates the time that is needed to construct the structure and perform a search in it and the data is saved in the file “results.txt” along with the pairs that have been searched and the number of times they appear in the file.

The text file goes through a transformation procedure which eliminates symbols and makes all letters lower case so that the count of the number of times a pair is stored is counted correctly.
   
The data structures that have been implemented are:

•	Non-Sorted Array

•	Sorted Array

•	Binary Search Tree

•	Hash Table (chaining)
